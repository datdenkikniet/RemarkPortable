## Some networking lingo

* Private and Public IP address.
* Network Address translation.
* Network mask. 
    * `192.168.0.0/24` -> mask is `/24` = 255.255.255.0 = 24 bits of network, 8 bits of host.
    * `2001:2043:dc02:7500::/60` -> mask is `/60` = 60 bits of network, 68 bits of host

???

A private address is an IP address that is barred from being routed on the public internet. Public addresses, on the other hand, are addresses that _can_ be routed on
the internet.

Network Address Translation, also known as NAT. It is a technique that can be used to map multiple private IP addresses to a single public IP, so that machines
using private IP addresses can still talk to the rest of the internet. 

Network mask: a mask that indicates which of the bits in an address make up the network part of the address, and which bits make up the host part.

### Benefits of IPv6
#### The protocol
]

* More all-encompassing standardization.
    * Neighbour Discovery Protocol.
    * Duplicate Address Detection.
    * Stateless Automatic Address Configuration.
* No more broadcast traffic.
* Host network size standardized to `/64`
* Extension headers

???

Important: mention that addresses are no longer rare, so you should use the bits you have!

.left-column66[
### Benefits of IPv6
#### The protocol
#### Network management
]

* No more NAT.
* SLAAC, NDP, DAD mean more plug-and-play configuration.
* Everything with an IPv6 address can be globally reachable.
* No more broadcast traffic.

???

Important: NAT != secure (only if you trust your ISP more than a VPN provider)

---
.left-column66[
### Benefits of IPv6
#### The protocol
#### Network management
#### For the internet
]

* Massively reduced global routing table. (From 500000 routed prefixes down to 21000)

---

.left-column66[
### Benefits of IPv6
#### The protocol
#### Network management
#### For a business
]

* Less work overall.
* IPv6 addresses are (practically) free.
* World is moving towards IPv6, lagging after may be bad!

???

Explain chicken-and-egg problem with switching to IPv6.

.left-column66[
### Migrating to IPv6
]

* NAT64
* Dual stack


---
.left-column66[
### Migrating to IPv6
#### NAT64
]

* Uses the address range range `64:ff9b::/96`.
* Requires DNS64 setup that returns IPv4 addresses mapped to that range.
* Stateful.

---
.left-column66[
### Migrating to IPv6
#### NAT64
#### Dual stack
]

* Hosts have both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.
* IPv4 addresses are mapped to and from IPv6 addresses by the OS.
* Uses the range `0:0:0:0:0:ffff/96`.
* Dual stack may mean more network to look after, but lower barrier to entry.
