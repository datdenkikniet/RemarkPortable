IPv5: experimental standard that tried to expand IPv4, but did not add enough to become a real standard.

]

.right-column[
* Standard published in 1981.
* Address space: 32 bits, for a total of $$2^{32} = 4.3 billion$$ addresses.
* Price for a single public IPv4 address: 50 USD.
* Universally deployed & supported.
* Individual addresses easy to remember.
    * Format: A.A.A.A where A is a number from 0 to 255.

Practically any device that has internet access supports IPv4. Smart TVs, computers, phones, other IoT devices, anything that supports WiFi, etc.

* Standard published in 1995.
* "New", but not that different.
* Address space: 128 bits, for a total of $$2^{128} = 3.4 * 10^{28} = 340\ unidecillion$$ addresses (a _lot_)
* Price for a single IPv6 address: free.
* Universally supported & widely deployed in enterprise setting, but lower deployment & support for end-users.
* Longer addresses may be more difficult to remember (even with concise notation).
    * Format: AAAA:AAAA:AAAA:AAAA:AAAA:AAAA:AAAA:AAAA where A is a hexadecimal digit.
    * Concise notation: longest block of contiguous 0's may be shortened, leading 0's left out.
    * Example: `2001:2043:1423:0000:0000:0000:0000:0001`
      can be shortened to `2001:2043:1432::1`

IPv6 is supported by most newer devices (mobile phones & 4G, enterprise gear, etc.) and used in mobile networks. Older consumer devices may not support it.

## Some networking lingo

* Network mask.
    * `/24` in ipv4: 24 bits of network, 8 bits of host
    * `/24` in ipv6: 24 bits of network, 106 bits of host
* Private and Public IP address.
    * `192.168.0.0/24`, `10.0.0.0/8`, etc. in IPv4.
    * `fe80::/10` in IPv6 (link local).
* Address space depletion.
* Network Address translation.
    * Port forwarding.
    * NAT reflection.
    * P2P networking practically impossible.
* Network allocation.

???

Network mask: a mask that indicates which of the bits in an address make up the network part of the address, and which bits make up the host part.
A private address is an IP address that is barred from being routed on the public internet. Public addresses, on the other hand, are addresses that _can_ be routed on
the internet.

Address space depletion.

Network Address Translation, also known as NAT. It is a technique that can be used to map multiple private IP addresses to a single public IP, so that machines
using private IP addresses can still talk to the rest of the internet.

NAT is a workaround, and requires more workarounds. It usually works for the consumer, but diagnosing problems with it is hard, as it hides the true origin
and destination of network traffic, unless you have access to the stateful NAT table in the device performing NAT.

NAT reflection. If two devices are on the same private network, behind a device that performs NAT, connecting to the public address requires that
the device that performs NAT is somehow involved in the exchange.

With NAT, P2P networking is practically impossible. Multiple nodes can only be reached by multiplexing over different ports on the transport layer (TCP & UDP), making
it impossible for those numbers to be predictable unless they are coordinated in some always-online, centralized system. P2P may decrease traffic through bottlenecked
connections.

Important: NAT does not add security, only if you trust your ISP more than a VPN provider. Basically security by obscurity.

## Why migrate to IPv6?

* IPv6 is the future: combats shortcomings of IPv4.
    * More detail to come.
    * Biggest problem of all: IPv4 address space depletion. Requires workarounds layered on top of workarounds.
* Predictable reachability means that P2P networking works.
* VPNs no longer necessary for non-security related purposes.
* Catch-22: ISPs don't migrate because businesses don't, businesses don't migrate because ISPs don't.

???

ISPs have been notoriously slow with the rollout. ISPs continue running IPv4 only, as it works for them, preventing businesses from adopting IPv6, because customers
can't use it anyways.

## Benefits of IPv6
### The protocol
]

* More all-encompassing standardization.
    * Neighbour Discovery Protocol.
    * Duplicate Address Detection.
    * Stateless Automatic Address Configuration.
* No more broadcast traffic, more focus on multicast.
* Host network size standardized to `/64`.
* Extension headers.

???

Important: mention that addresses are no longer rare, so you should use the bits you have!

Because it's easier to implement, many constrainted resource IoT devices (smart lamps, newer smart fridges, home assistants)
already use IPv6.

---

.left-column66[
## Benefits of IPv6
### The protocol
### Network management
]

* No more NAT.
* SLAAC, NDP, DAD mean more plug-and-play configuration.
* More opportunity for global reachability.
* No more broadcast traffic.
* Reduced global routing table. (From 500000 routed prefixes down to 21000)

???

Opportunity for global reachability does _not_ mean that everything is globally reachable by default. It is still important to configure your firewall properly, but
will enable you to do P2P networking _without_ requiring ugly hacks such as port-forwarding.

.left-column66[

]

* IPv6 natively supports IPSec.

.left-column66[

### For a business
]

* Less work overall.
* IPv6 addresses are (practically) free.
* World is moving towards IPv6, lagging after may be bad!
* Downside: transitioning may take some time & effort.

---
.left-column66[
## Migrating to IPv6
### NAT64
]

* Uses the address range range `64:ff9b::/96`.
* Requires DNS64 setup that returns IPv4 addresses mapped into that range.
* Stateful.

## Migrating to IPv6
### NAT64
### Dual stack
]

* Hosts have both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.
* IPv4 traffic is mapped to and from IPv6 traffic by the OS.
* Uses the range `0:0:0:0:0:ffff/96`.
* Dual stack may mean more network to look after, but lower barrier to entry.

.left-column66[
## Migrating to IPv6
### NAT64
### Dual stack
]

Before: 
```
socket = openIpv4Socket("0.0.0.0", 80);
```
Allows only IPv4 clients to connect, node is required to have only IPv4 address.

---

.left-column66[
## Migrating to IPv6
### NAT64
### Dual stack
]

After:
```
socket = openIpV6Socket("::", 80);
```
1. If node has IPv6 address, allows IPv6 clients to connect.
2. If node has IPv4 address & OS has dual-stack support, allows IPv4 clients to connect.
    * IPv4 client from 155.132.142.33 will appear to connect as `::ffff:9b84:8f21`.
3. Done!

---

## Summary

* Faster, uses fewer resources with more addresses.
* Easier to reason about.
* Makes network management easier.
* Much more plug-and-play.
* Every IoT device uses it.
* Possibilities for migration exist.
