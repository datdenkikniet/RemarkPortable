* More all-encompassing standardization.
    * Neighbour Discovery Protocol.
    * Duplicate Address Detection.
    * Stateless Automatic Address Configuration.
* No more broadcast traffic.
* Host network size standardized to `/64`
* Extension headers

Important: mention that addresses are no longer rare, so you should use the bits you have!

## Some networking lingo

* Network mask.
    * `/24` in ipv4: 24 bits of network, 8 bits of host
    * `/24` in ipv6: 24 bits of network, 106 bits of host
* Private and Public IP address.
    * `192.168.0.0/24`, `10.0.0.0/8`, etc. in IPv4.
    * `fe80::/10` in IPv6 (link local).
* Address space depletion.
* Network Address translation.
    * NAT reflection.
    * P2P networking practically impossible.

Network mask: a mask that indicates which of the bits in an address make up the network part of the address, and which bits make up the host part.

A private address is an IP address that is barred from being routed on the public internet. Public addresses, on the other hand, are addresses that _can_ be routed on
the internet.

Address space depletion.

Network Address Translation, also known as NAT. It is a technique that can be used to map multiple private IP addresses to a single public IP, so that machines
using private IP addresses can still talk to the rest of the internet.

NAT is a workaround, and requires more workarounds. It usually works for the consumer, but diagnosing problems with it is hard, as it hides the true origin
and destination of network traffic, unless you have access to the stateful NAT table in the device performing NAT.

NAT reflection. If two devices are on the same private network, behind a device that performs NAT, connecting to the public address requires that
the device that performs NAT is somehow involved in the exchange.

With NAT, P2P networking is practically impossible. Multiple nodes can only be reached by multiplexing over different ports on the transport layer (TCP & UDP), making
it impossible for those numbers to be predictable unless they are coordinated in some always-online, centralized system. P2P may decrease traffic through bottlenecked
connections.

Important: NAT != secure (only if you trust your ISP more than a VPN provider).

* No more NAT.
* SLAAC, NDP, DAD mean more plug-and-play configuration.
* More opportunity for global reachability.
* No more broadcast traffic.

* Reduced global routing table. (From 500000 routed prefixes down to 21000)

]

* Less work overall.
* IPv6 addresses are (practically) free.
* World is moving towards IPv6, lagging after may be bad!
* Large downside: transitioning takes quite some time & effort.

Explain chicken-and-egg problem with switching to IPv6.

### Migrating to IPv6
#### NAT64
]

* Uses the address range range `64:ff9b::/96`.
* Requires DNS64 setup that returns IPv4 addresses mapped into that range.
* Stateful.

.left-column66[
### Migrating to IPv6
#### NAT64
#### Dual stack
]

* Hosts have both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.
* IPv4 addresses are mapped to and from IPv6 addresses by the OS.
* Uses the range `0:0:0:0:0:ffff/96`.
* Dual stack may mean more network to look after, but lower barrier to entry.

#### Dual stack
]

Before: 
```
socket = openIpv4Socket("0.0.0.0", 80);
```
Allows only IPv4 clients to connect, node is required to have only IPv4 address.

After:
```
socket = openIpV6Socket("::", 80);
```
1. If node has IPv6 address, allows IPv6 clients to connect.
2. If node has IPv4 address & OS has dual-stack support, allows IPv4 clients to connect.
    * IPv4 client from 155.132.142.33 will appear to connect as `::ffff:9b84:8f21`.
3. Done!
